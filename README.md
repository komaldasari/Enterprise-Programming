# Enterprise-Programming
This project is a Java-based Online Banking System web application designed to simulate core banking functionalities such as user registration, login, loan application, and transaction viewing. Built using Java Servlets for backend logic and JSP (JavaServer Pages) for dynamic web content, the system follows a basic MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The frontend is styled with CSS, and various images are used to enhance the user interface, while Maven is used for dependency management and project structure. The backend handles essential functions through classes like LoginServlet.java, register.java, customer.java, and Customermanager.java, with servlet endpoints configured in the web.xml deployment descriptor. Although the backend logic is well-structured for handling user operations, the project lacks database connectivity, input validation, and security features such as session management and password encryption, indicating that it is an early-stage or academic prototype developed in the Eclipse IDE environment.
